## Decisions for overfitting

* When BQ is NAN all classes are 0
* Epsilon +1 as a variables to account for data drift
* 


## FE day :) 
- [outliers in multiple values is more likely to be a positive test use](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarthakmehra03/icr-analysis-and-modelling)
- [sklearn RFE for feature selection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html)



## Extra Todo:
- Calibration curve for predictions


* (7/3/2023) assumption that the public test set leans more towards class 0 observations and that models predicting more low scores than high scores are performin better
