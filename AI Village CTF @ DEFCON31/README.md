# Comments
This competition is very different from others I have done on Kaggle, less data science and more an overlap with computer science, hacking, and ML models. I really enjoyed it but unfortunately I only got to work dedicated to it for 2 weeks out of the total 4 weeks. 
I didn't get to test all the problems out as hard as I would've liked, but I do think it was certainly an interesting experience. 

# Learnings: 
- I learned a lot about adversarial Computer Vision models ([leveraging ART](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox)). There is a depth of knowledge in this field and although it isn't my favorite of the ML fields it is certainly entertaining to learn about how crackable modern day computer vision models are. #7,8,9 Granny
- There were a lot of LLM challenges in this competition. To me, they were all quite easy, just somewhat time consuming. I found some interesting ways to break them, like chaning language you are speaking rapidly, and asking for emergency help always does the trick. #12,14,18,19,20,21,22,23,26,27
- I spent a couple hours learning and reading about how insecure pickle files are ([reference](https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/)). Which was something I had never even thought of how the serilization worked in the past. Can surely use this for a funny prank or two in the future. #25 pickle
- I learned that no matter what dataset version you use, there are copies across all open source libraries that are different (counting problems MNIST & CIFAR) #5 & #6 
- I enjoyed hacking away. I hope they do this competition again in the future.
